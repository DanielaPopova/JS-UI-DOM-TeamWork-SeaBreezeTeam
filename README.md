## Project Description

The Programmer’s Nightmare is a browser game written in JavaScript using the
Phaser framework - an open-source HTML5 framework for Canvas and WebGL. The
project is a part of the “JS DOM and UI” course in Telerik Academy.


## Storyline

Currently, Peter studies software engineering at a prestigious academy. He is
extremely hard-working and dedicated student, and despite the difficulties he’s
encountered on the way to the fulfillment of his dream - becoming a software ninja,
Peter manages to successfully take each exam and continue to the next course. Of
course, success does not come lightly – poor social life, unhealthy food, long nights
writing countless lines of code. 


Peter is so obsessed with writing code all day and
night that one evening, while drifting comfortably on the desk in front of his laptop,
Peter falls asleep and in his dream it seems as if he is inside his own computer and
he’s looking like a ninja! "How cool is that!?", would be your first thought, but very
soon Peter’s wonderful dream turns into a horrifying nightmare! Help our friend
overcome the attacks of the ruthless ninja boss and escape this computer world.


## Controls

You can navigate the player by pressing the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys and the UP key
for jumping. Use the action key – SPACEBAR – to pass through the door, located at
the bottom of the map. Your goal is to reach the boss’s room and escape through
the exit at the far end of it. To achieve that, you should first find the key that opens
the front door.

Along the way you’ll meet the octocats – unstoppable moving
creatures that can cost you one health bar, so try to avoid them! Some lives are
scattered around the map to give you strength and thus help you with your mission.

There are also items to collect – each of them brings you 10 points to your score.
When you enter the final stage of the game – boss’s room, you’ll notice ones and 
zeroes appearing randomly around you – by taking the zeroes you’ll increase the
velocity of the ninja boss, the ones help decrease it so you can pass through the
boss and win the game. Good luck and may the code be with you!
